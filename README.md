# GraniteAI
GraniteAI is an open source automated machine learning and data mining platorm

## Features
### Visulisation
The GraniteAI plotting library allows user to quickly visualise trends in their data, including getting statistics from within separate groups.

### Automated machine learning
GraniteAI uses Bayesian optimisation to efficiently fit model hyperparameters. All models are built using scikit-learn pipelines that automatically preprocess the data, allowing numeric, categoric, and text data types.

### Understandable AI
Understand the decisions being made using feature importance, showing the most important variables underlying the data, or reason codes, to see what impacts the model predictions the most.
